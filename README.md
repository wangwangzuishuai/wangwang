# wangwangThe interaction of positive and negative energy : energy can be divided into positive energy, negative energy and massless energy. Negative energy is also accelerated by gravity. When the negative energy enters the gravity field, the greater the difference between its direction and gravity, the more significant the impact. The negative energy can be offset with the residual energy of the positive energy, thus forming an integer dimension of the material. 
Upgrading and collision of material dimensions : Through the collision model of a straight line and a plane composed of n straight lines, we obtain a formula describing the upgrading of material dimensions. The formula reveals that the process of rising from one integer dimension to another is similar to the bank 's compound interest calculation. The quantum of each collision goes through Ï€ times, and each collision is similar to a new collision direction.
The essence of gravity : gravity is not negative energy, but caused by the difference between the new dimension generated by positive energy and the new dimension generated by negative energy. Because positive energy is a compressed space, there is always more positive energy in the new dimension, so gravity is the resultant force of the new dimension.
